Contributing to this project
====================================

# The pull request should have a useful title. Pull requests with `Update readme.md` as title will be closed right away
because I'm so tired of nobody reading this document. Please carefully read everything in `Adding to this list`.

Version Control - Forking
-------------------------

* Always **Fork the Dev-Master branch** for your work. This makes
  it safer and easier to incorporate your work into the newest
  version of our Awesome-Rshiny list.

* Always **Have a Useful Title**.

* Always answer the questions in **The Pull Request Template**, when
you are submitting a new PR.  If you want your name added, then
write your name, and then add an appropriate link for people to click on.

Code formatting
---------------

* **Follow the style you see used in the primary repository**! Consistency with
  the rest of the project always trumps other considerations.
* Python projects usually follow the `PEP-8
  <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ guidelines (though many have
  minor deviations depending on the lead maintainers' preferences.)

Documentation
-------------

* Make sure that when you add to the list that:
    1. It belongs in that section.
    2. The title makes sense.
    3. The link works.
